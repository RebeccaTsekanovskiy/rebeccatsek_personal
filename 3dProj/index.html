        <h2 class="returning">What should I expect as a return student?</h2>
        <p class ="info">Returning students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) can 
            expect a familiar yet evolving environment. They'll encounter a campus community 
            that continues to emphasize academic rigor and innovation while offering 
            opportunities for personal and professional growth. As returning students
             progress through their academic programs, they can anticipate more 
             specialized coursework, research opportunities, and increased involvement 
             in extracurricular activities aligned with their interests.

            Returning students often have a deeper understanding of campus resources and 
            may take on leadership roles within clubs, organizations, or research initiatives. 
            They'll continue to benefit from the support of faculty mentors and advisors 
            while having the opportunity to delve deeper into their chosen fields of study.
            
            Moreover, returning students might witness ongoing improvements and developments

        <h2 class="returning">Where will I live?</h2>
        <p class="info">
            Returning students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) have various housing 
            options available to them. They can choose to live in on-campus housing, 
            such as residence halls or university-owned apartments, where they might 
            have the opportunity to live in specialized housing communities or 
            upperclassman-focused living spaces.

            Some returning students may opt for off-campus housing, exploring 
            apartments or rental properties in the surrounding areas of Troy, New York, 
            where RPI is located. Off-campus housing offers a different living experience 
            and more independence but often requires students to manage their accommodations 
            independently.
            
            Additionally, as returning students progress through their academic 
            journey, they might explore different housing options, seeking roommates 
            or living situations that align with their changing preferences and lifestyles. 
            RPI aims to support returning students in finding housing that suits their needs, 
            whether they prefer the convenience of on-campus residences or the independence 
            of off-campus living.
